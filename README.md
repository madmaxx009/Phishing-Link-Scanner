# Phishing-Link-Scanner

## Description  
This is a simple Python-based tool that scans URLs to detect potential phishing attempts. It uses heuristic checks such as keyword analysis, shortened URL detection, and suspicious domain structures to help identify malicious links.

---

## Features  
-  Checks for common phishing keywords in the URL  
-  Detects usage of known URL shorteners (e.g., bit.ly, t.co)  
-  Analyzes domain structure for suspicious patterns  
-  Resolves and displays redirection URLs  
-  Lightweight and command-line friendly

---

## How It Works  
The tool uses the following heuristics to flag a URL as suspicious:

1. **Phishing Keywords**: Checks if the URL contains terms like `login`, `verify`, `account`, `secure`, etc.  
2. **Shortened URLs**: Detects if the link is masked using a shortener like `bit.ly`, `t.co`, etc.  
3. **Suspicious Domain Structure**: Flags domains with an unusually high number of dots (e.g., `secure-login-update.freegift.com.info.biz`).  
4. **Redirections**: Follows redirects and alerts if the final destination differs from the input.
